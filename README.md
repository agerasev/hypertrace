# HyperTrace

Lobachevsky (hyperbolic) space ray tracer powered by OpenCL.

## Requirements

+ OpenCL
+ SDL2
+ SDL2_Image

## TODO

- [ ] Euclidean geometry
- [x] Lobachevsky (hyperbolic) geometry
- [ ] Spherical geometry

- [x] Specular material 
- [x] Lambertian material
- [x] Transparent material
- [ ] Refraction
- [ ] Diffusion on fog
- [ ] Arbitrary BRDF

- [x] Square horosphere tiling
- [x] Hexagonal horosphere tiling
- [x] Pentagonal hyperbolic plane tiling
- [ ] Heptagonal hyperbolic plane tiling

- [x] Lens blur (depth of field)
- [x] Motion blur
- [+] Motion blur on moving objects

- [x] Gamma correction
- [ ] Noise reduction (maybe using DL)

- [ ] Same RNG seed for work group to reduce divergence
